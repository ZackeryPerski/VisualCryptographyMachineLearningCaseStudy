# VisualCryptographyMachineLearningCaseStudy
This repository contains the project files to build a FFN and a CNN that is capable of classifying overlayed images that are utilizing a visual cryptography scheme.

To run this project, you will first need to run the imagePreparer.py file to generate the testing and training sets. These are dynamically created and not downloaded from anywhere.
You will need at least 7 GB of local storage to utilize this project, the majority consumed by the produced images encoded in json format.

Known Issues: JSON dumps can take a particularly long time to complete, especially the first dump containing approximately 5.8GB of data.
